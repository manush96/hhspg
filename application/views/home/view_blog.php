                                                    <p>I came to this city, fresh from college as thousand others, full of dreams and aspirations, aimed to achieve something big. Little did I knew, that I was entering a maze that would continue till eternity. The moment I stepped out of the train, I looked around. The place and especially people, all was new for me. But I knew I was about to enter my own world of independence. It was a bright morning and I was wandering on streets, in search of a nice place to live. After roaming for a couple of hours and talking to various sort of people, I found an affordable flat, owned by a decent couple. Three people were already living there, and I was the fourth to join the team. I had a couple of heavy bags (‘cause my mom was worried about what would I eat in a strange city).
As I entered the room, it was just the I always thought of ( how guys live in an apartment). Clothes on the couch, trash littered on the floor, pieces of cigarettes in the corner and bundle of notes on the board. I had handshakes, asked names and a short “Hi”, “What’s up dude?” session with my flatmates. They left for work, and I was there alone, a little nervous, and excited at the same time to live in this world I’ve always dreamt of.


Day 1 was tiring and mostly consumed in unpacking and cleaning around. Later that night, when everyone returned, we exchanged talks about friends, families, politics and had dinner together. Days started passing by, and I became good friends with everyone. We started going to pubs and bars on weekends together. Sometimes, we had one of those late-night, deep conversations, where everyone either discussed heavy-sentimental issues or showed concern about their future. But then, a couple of beers and we were back to “our fun”. 


Months passed and our bond grew stronger. Lately, I reached a stage in my life when you’ve lived your life in PG, made some “bros for life”, but you’ve to leave to another city for a new job. 


My journey has been beautiful, but moving out is bitter. I felt like a daughter, leaving her home after marriage. Though there were was no crying,  yet sadness filled my heart. We exchanged few hi5’s, good luck for future and “Damn, I’ll miss you a lot” faces. 


My cab arrived and I stepped out my PG, not knowing when will I these faces again. I turned around and looked at them for one last time. With a big smile and a heavy heart, I was about to enter a new life again, where I would have to go through this again. As I passed by, I wished I could rewind the clock and relive those moments. 


Sometimes, living in the past is better and peaceful than dreaming about the future….
